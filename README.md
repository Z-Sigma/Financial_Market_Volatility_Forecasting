## Financial Market Volatility Forecasting

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on forecasting financial market volatility using a LightGBM model. The goal of the project is to accurately predict short-term volatility of various stocks.

### Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts volatility in financial markets. The project utilizes a dataset of 428,932 rows, containing detailed financial data for various stocks across different sectors. The target variable is the volatility of the underlying product, which plays a crucial role in options trading.

### Methodology:
The project leverages the LightGBM algorithm, a gradient boosting framework that excels in handling large datasets and providing accurate predictions. The model is trained using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to optimize its performance and minimize prediction errors.

### Key Features:
- Dataset: The dataset consists of extensive financial data, offering a wealth of information for modeling volatility.
- Model Development: A LightGBM model is built to forecast short-term volatility, with the aim of accurately predicting market fluctuations.
- Performance Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using out-of-fold RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error) as the evaluation metric.
- Insights and Impact: The project provides valuable insights into volatility forecasting and its potential impact on trading decisions, helping to improve market access and prices for various financial instruments.

### Requirements:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- LightGBM

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the development of a LightGBM model for financial market volatility forecasting. By accurately predicting volatility, it provides valuable insights and potential impacts on trading decisions. The project aims to contribute to the improvement of financial markets by enabling better access and prices for various financial instruments.

**Note:** The dataset used in this project is not provided in this repository due to its size and proprietary nature.
